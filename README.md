# TextDetectionCV
This repository contains a Python script for detecting and displaying text in images using OpenCV and EasyOCR. The script reads an image, uses EasyOCR to detect text, and then visualizes the detected text by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the image. The processed image is displayed using Matplotlib.
